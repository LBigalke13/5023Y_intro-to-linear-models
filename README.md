# 5023Y_intro-to-linear-models

## workshop 1 - 30/01/2023

### Introduction to Statistics
Today we reviewed how to organise data and worked through chapter 12 of the coursebook. We did some simple statisitcal work including finding the mean, standard deviation, and standard error and how we can use these them in calculations. We also generated a graph showing the sample mean and standard deviation.


## workshop 2 - 10/02/2023

### Introduction to Linear Models
Today we worked through chapter 13 of the coursebook. We reviewed what we learnt in the lecture earlier this week, including how we can use linear models and statistical formulae to find the standard deviation and variances. We used the dataset "darwin" to find the above said and worked out the means and their differences. We generated different graphs showing the the sample means and their differences.
