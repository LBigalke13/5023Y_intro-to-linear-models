## workshop 1 - 30/01/2023

### Introduction to Statistics
Today we reviewed how to organise data and worked through chapter 12 of the coursebook. We did some simple statisitcal work including finding the mean, standard deviation, and standard error and how we can use these them in calculations. We also generated a graph showing the sample mean and standard deviation.
